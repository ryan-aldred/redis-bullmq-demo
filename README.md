## Introduction

Ever wanted to see the least amount of effort put into a demo? Well, you've come to the right place. This repository exists solely to demonstrate the basic integration of BullMQ, Redis, Bun, and TypeScript. Don't expect any bells, whistles, or fancy features.

## Requirements

Because we like to make things difficult, here are the tools you'll need to make this demo run:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version, because why not)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) (Good luck with that)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (Because npm is too mainstream)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Because JavaScript is for amateurs)

## Installation

Here's where the fun begins. Follow these steps if you dare:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ryan-aldred/redis-bullmq-demo.git
   ```

   Yes, you read that right. We're using Git.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd redis-bullmq-demo
   ```

3. Install dependencies with Bun, because who doesn't love obscure package managers:
   ```sh
   bun install
   ```

## Usage

Running this demo is almost as exciting as watching paint dry. Follow these simple steps:

1. Start Redis:

   ```sh
   redis-server
   ```

   If you don't know how to do this, I'm afraid this repo isn't for you.

2. Run a script to add ajob

   ```sh
   bun run index.ts
   ```

## Contributing

Please don't. But if you absolutely must, here's how:

1. Fork the repository. Or don't. It's your life.
2. Create a new branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
3. Make your changes. Or not. Who cares?
4. Commit your changes:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Add something pointless"
   ```
5. Push to the branch:
   ```sh
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```
6. Open a pull request. Or just stare at your screen blankly. It's all the same to us.
